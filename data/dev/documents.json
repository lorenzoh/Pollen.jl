you are probably reading this on After reading this you will have learned how to create a Julia package and set up Pollen as its documentation system use Pollen’s development server with live reload to preview changes as you make them and how to publish the package documentation to GitHub Pages You can see the resulting project and its documentation at  lorenzoh/PollenExample  jl  Installation Before starting the tutorial make sure you’ve followed the  installation instructions for Pollen  jl  Creating a package with Pollen  jl documentation Documentation for an existing package This section describes how to add Pollen documentation when creating a new package It is also possible to add Pollen.jl documentation to an existing package  as described here  The most commonly used tool for creating new Julia packages is  PkgTemplates  jl  Pollen.jl provides a plugin for PkgTemplates.jl to spare you any arduous setup tasks To create a template make sure you have  PkgTemplates  installed and create a template with the Pollen plugin Following along If you want to follow along and host the tutorial project on GitHub pages make sure to replace  lorenzoh  with your GitHub user name Next we’ll instantiate the template by calling it with the name of the package we want to create Once this is done you’ll have a brand new package ready to use Pollen.jl’s documentation system Writing documentation interactively Now we’ll work on the documentation and preview it locally The package files were generated in Julia’s package development directory We’ll activate the package’s documentation environment so that we can load the created package and Pollen itself and then start the documentation development server Once you see messages that two servers are running on ports 3000 and 8000 you can click the first link  http://localhost:3000/dev/i  to see a preview of the documentation The first time we run this Pollen has to install the frontend but subsequent runs will be much faster The opened page should look like this The landing page shows our package’s  README.md  which of course is almost empty Let’s keep the server running and edit the file for example by adding some text under the heading Save the file return to the documentation web page and  press  R  The page should update with the text you added to the README For example Great job We just updated part of the documentation While there are a lot more things we could change about the docs at this point we’ll leave them for another tutorial and get to the last part in this tutorial publishing our package’s documentation as a website Publishing the documentation on GitHub Pages If you used the template from the first part of this tutorial the package directory will already be a git repository First we need to make sure to commit the changes we made above Now you’ll need to create a GitHub repository at  username/PollenExample.jl  If you used your GitHub user in the template above the local repository’s remote should be set up correctly Now we’ll push our changes and also two helper branches that Pollen uses to host a page That’s it After about 10 minutes you’ll have a documentation page built at  username.github.io/PollenExample.jl/dev/i  Now every time you push changes to your package’s  main  branch the documentation page will be updated Now that we’ve built a workflow for publishing documentation it’s time to find out how you to organize your documentation follow-up tutorial coming soon

documents and how to load them from different file formats as wells as transform them At its core Pollen is a package for creating and transforming documents For example this documentation is comprised of many different documents This page for example is created from a Markdown file which you can find here  Pollen.jl/docs/tutorials/documents.md  This tutorial will give you some insight into how Pollen documents are represented and how this representation makes many forms of common document processing steps possible Documents as trees If you have worked with HTML before you’ll know that it uses a tree-like data format to represent documents For example the following is an HTML snippet of a paragraph with some marked up text Pollen similarly represents documents as a tree We can represent the above HTML as follows using Pollen Format  independent documents HTML is a natural source for this kind of data but Pollen can read or write documents from and to different formats like Markdown files Julia source files Jupyter notebooks and JSON For example we can parse Markdown text and render it back as HTML Supporting many different formats allows us to work with different source documents and apply the same set of powerful transformations to documents So what can we actually do with our documents Transforming documents Pollen uses document transformations to implement many different features like executing code cells syntax highlighting finding hyperreferences and more To get a feel for this let’s implement the following transformation given a document with  code  tags evaluate the code as a Julia expression and replace it with the resulting value For example let’s say we have this document parsed from Markdown for convenience The result that we want is the same document but the  2  2  replaced with the result of the calculation 4 Finding the code tags To transform the code  2  2  we first need to find it For this we’ll use a  Selector  Selectors allow us to find specific nodes or leaves in a document tree Here we’ll use  SelectTag  to find all nodes with a  code  tag Next we need to extract the string of code Using  children  we can see that the node has 1 child a  Leaf  with a string value We can get the leaf value with empty index notation    And we can execute the code Now we know how to find nodes with code how to get the code string and how to run it In the next step we’ll create a function that modifies a document replacing code with its result Transforming the tree If our document was a list of nodes we could find the relevant elements and  map  the code-running function over them We can do something similar to a tree with a so-called catamorphism At the risk of upsetting category theorists I’ll say that a catamorphism can be seen as  a  map  over trees  Pollen implements it as the function  cata  which takes a function and a tree as arguments The function is applied to all nodes and leaves resulting in a new tree 🌳 For example we can use it to modify the tags of all nodes cata  can also take a  Selector  as a third argument If specified only the nodes matchign the selector will be modified We’ll use the above selector to map our code-running function over all nodes with a  code  tag With this we’ve implemented a reusable transformation that can be applied to other documents as well Go ahead and try it with some other examples Finally we can render the resulting document out to HTML We wrap the HTML string in  Base.HTML  so that it’s displayed as such
